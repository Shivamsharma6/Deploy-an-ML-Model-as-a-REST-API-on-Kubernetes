# Deploy an ML Model as a REST API on Kubernetes

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end MLOps workflow** â€” from training a Machine Learning model to deploying it as a **scalable REST API** using **Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible**.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to build, containerize, and deploy an **Iris flower classification model** as a REST API that can predict the flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

## Model Details

The model used is a **Logistic Regression classifier** trained on the classic **Iris dataset**.

### Features
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

### Target
- Predicts species: `setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`
